# Full Video Pipeline — Autonomous YouTube Video Production

> A 13-step pipeline that takes a topic idea and produces a fully rendered YouTube
> video with voiceover, visuals, audio, title/description/tags, and a Remotion-
> generated thumbnail. Each step is self-contained with clear inputs, outputs,
> and validation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, verify system readiness:

```bash
bash scripts/check_system.sh
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt   # edge-tts, jsonschema, psutil
```

If pre-flight fails, resolve issues before proceeding. Required tools:
- Linux (the pipeline is Linux-only)
- `node` + `npm` (for Remotion)
- `python3` + `pip` (for edge-tts and helper scripts; `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`)
- `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` (for audio/video processing)
- `git` (for cloning skill references)

## Audio Path (IMPORTANT — overrides remotion-best-practices skill)

Voiceover is **NOT** baked into scene MP4s. Scene components render silent
video only — do NOT use `<Audio>` in `SceneXX.tsx`. At stitch time,
`scripts/assemble.py` concatenates the per-scene MP3s into one
`voiceover_aligned.mp3` and muxes it onto the concatenated scene MP4s in a
single ffmpeg pass. This:

- Avoids Chrome decoding/syncing audio once per scene (faster renders)
- Keeps exactly one audio encode pass total (fastest path for low-RAM boxes)
- Relies on `actual_duration_frames` matching voiceover durations, enforced by Step 6

The remotion-best-practices submodule (`skills/remotion-best-practices/`)
may still document `<Audio>` / voiceover patterns. Those patterns are
**superseded for this pipeline** — render silent, mux at stitch.

## Optional: Captions

After Step 6 (duration measurement), you can generate captions:

```bash
python3 pipeline.py captions <title>
```

This produces `videos/<title>/<title>.srt` (YouTube sidecar) and populates
per-scene `captions` cues in `scenes.json`. To burn captions into the video,
set `video.burn_captions: true` in `pipeline_config.json` — the scaffolded
`MainVideo.tsx` will then render the shared `<Captions>` component from
`remotion-foundation` when a scene has captions and `showCaptions` is true.
Off by default to preserve render performance.

## Configuration

Default settings are in `pipeline_config.json`. Override per-video as needed:
- `video.fps`, `video.width`, `video.height` — composition settings
- `voiceover.voice` — edge-tts voice name (list voices: `edge-tts --list-voices`)
- `render.*` — rendering guardrails (concurrency, codec, memory limits)
- `system.*` — resource thresholds

## Pipeline Steps

Execute steps 1-10 in strict order. Each step must complete and validate before
moving to the next. Use `pipeline_state.json` to track progress.

---

### STEP 1: Topic Selection

**Goal**: Choose a specific, trending topic for the video.

**Action**:
1. Ask the user for a niche or category (if not provided).
2. Perform 3-5 web searches to identify trending topics in that niche.
3. Select the most promising topic based on: search volume signals, freshness,
   audience interest, and content depth potential.
4. State the chosen topic clearly.

**Output**: Topic decision (stored in context, written to `pipeline_state.json`).

**Validation**: Topic is specific enough to fill 3-10 minutes of content. Not too
broad ("technology"), not too narrow ("the 3rd screw on the iPhone 15 camera").

---

### STEP 2: Research

**Goal**: Compile comprehensive, accurate information on the chosen topic.

**Action**:
1. Perform 5-10 targeted web searches on the topic.
2. Visit and extract key information from the top results.
3. Compile: key facts, statistics, expert quotes, examples, counterarguments,
   timeline/history, current state, future outlook.
4. Verify critical claims with at least 2 sources.
5. Organize findings by subtopic.

**Output**: Research notes (kept in agent context, key facts transferred to script).

**Validation**:
- At least 3 verifiable facts or statistics gathered.
- Multiple perspectives covered.
- Information is current (within last 12 months for news/trends).

---

### STEP 3: Script Writing

**Goal**: Write a retention-optimized script with discrete ~10-second scenes.

**Action**:
1. Load the YouTube script sub-skill reference:
   `skills/claude-youtube/skills/claude-youtube/sub-skills/script.md`
2. Also load the retention scripting guide:
   `skills/claude-youtube/skills/claude-youtube/references/retention-scripting-guide.md`
3. Adapt the script structure into **scene-based format** (~10 seconds per scene).
4. Write the full script to `SCRIPT.md`.
5. Write the structured scene data to `scenes.json`.

**Script structure** (adapted from the YouTube skill):

```
HOOK (0:00-0:30): 3 scenes — Grab, Promise, Stakes
INTRO (0:30-1:30): 6 scenes — Context, credibility, viewer outcome
CONTENT BLOCKS: 6-10 scenes each — Pattern interrupt, value, micro-summary, forward hook
MID-CTA (~25%): 1 scene — Soft call to action
RETENTION RE-HOOK (~60%): 1 scene — Re-engage dropping viewers
OUTRO (final 60s): 6 scenes — Hard CTA, end screen, next video tease
```

**SCRIPT.md format**:

```markdown
# Script: {Video Title}

## Scene 1: [Title] (~10s)
**Script:** [What appears on screen / narration context]
**Voiceover:** [Exact words to be spoken]
**Transition:** [fade/cut/wipe/slide]

## Scene 2: [Title] (~10s)
...
```

**scenes.json**: Must follow the schema in `schemas/scenes.schema.json`. Initialize
with `actual_duration_seconds: null` and `render_status: "pending"`.

**Output**: `SCRIPT.md` and `scenes.json` in the video directory.

**Validation**:
- All scenes have: id, title, script_text, voiceover_text, target_duration_seconds.
- Total estimated duration matches target video length (within 10%).
- Hook has all 3 elements (grab, promise, stakes).
- Pattern interrupts appear every 3-5 scenes (every 60-90s).
- Mid-CTA present around 25% mark.
- Retention re-hook present around 60% mark.
- Script reads as natural spoken language, not written prose.

---

### STEP 4: Voiceover Writing

**Goal**: Extract voiceover text into a parseable format for TTS generation.

**Action**:
1. Read `SCRIPT.md`.
2. Extract the "Voiceover:" line from each scene.
3. Write `VOICEOVER.md` in the standardized format:

```markdown
# VOICEOVER
---SCENE:1---
[Exact voiceover text for scene 1 — what TTS will speak]
---END---
---SCENE:2---
[Exact voiceover text for scene 2]
---END---
```

**Output**: `VOICEOVER.md` in the video directory.

**Validation**:
- Every scene from `scenes.json` has a corresponding `---SCENE:N---` block.
- No empty voiceover blocks.
- Text is clean — no stage directions, no markdown formatting, just spoken words.
- Scene count in VOICEOVER.md matches scenes.json scene count.

---

### STEP 5: Voiceover Generation

**Goal**: Generate MP3 audio files for each scene using edge-tts.

**Action**:
1. Run the voiceover generation script:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_voiceover.py videos/{video-title}/ --voice {voice_name}
```

The voice name comes from `pipeline_config.json` (default: `en-GB-RyanNeural`).
User can override with `--voice en-GB-SoniaNeural` or similar. Concurrency is
configurable via `voiceover.concurrency` (default 3).

2. The script will:
   - Parse `VOICEOVER.md` for scene delimiters
   - Compute a SHA-256 `voiceover_hash` for each scene from
     `(text, voice, rate, volume, pitch)`
   - **Skip generation** for any scene whose MP3 already exists AND whose stored
     `voiceover_hash` matches (idempotent — editing VOICEOVER.md and re-running
     only regenerates the changed scenes)
   - Generate MP3s concurrently up to `voiceover.concurrency`
   - Retry each failed scene once after a 5s backoff
   - Measure each file's duration
   - Atomically update `scenes.json` with file paths, durations, and hashes

**Output**: `voiceover/scene-XX.mp3` files + updated `scenes.json`.

**Validation**:
- All MP3 files exist in `voiceover/` directory and have non-zero size.
- `scenes.json` has `voiceover_file`, `voiceover_hash`, and
  `actual_duration_seconds` populated for every scene.
- If any scene failed after retry, re-run the script — the failed scenes will
  be retried while unchanged ones are skipped.

---

### STEP 6: Duration Measurement

**Goal**: Verify and finalize the real durations of all voiceover audio files.

**Action**:
1. Run the duration measurement script:

```bash
python3 scripts/measure_durations.py videos/{video-title}/
```

2. The script will:
   - Use ffprobe to measure each MP3
   - Calculate `actual_duration_frames = ceil(duration * fps)`
   - Update `scenes.json` with real values
   - Print total video duration

**Output**: Updated `scenes.json` with `actual_duration_seconds` and `actual_duration_frames`.

**Validation**:
- Every scene has non-null `actual_duration_seconds` and `actual_duration_frames`.
- No scene duration is 0.
- Total duration is reasonable for the target length.
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT proceed to Step 7 until ALL scene durations are measured.
  The Remotion compositions depend on exact frame counts.

---

### STEP 7: Style Definition

**Goal**: Define a consistent visual style for the entire video.

**Action**:
1. Read the video topic, script tone, and target audience.
2. Decide on a visual style that fits the content:
   - Color palette (3-5 hex colors)
   - Typography (1-2 font families, sizes)
   - Background treatment (gradients, solid, patterns)
   - Animation character (smooth, snappy, minimal, bold)
   - Element positioning rules
3. Write `STYLES.md` in the video directory.
4. Update `scenes.json` with `visual_notes` for each scene based on the style guide.
   - Each scene gets a specific visual treatment: colors, animations, layout, elements
   - `visual_notes` should be detailed enough for Step 8 to implement directly
   - Reference specific colors from the palette, animation types, and element positions

**STYLES.md format**:

```markdown
# Visual Style Guide

## Color Palette
- Primary: #HEXCODE — [usage]
- Secondary: #HEXCODE — [usage]
- Accent: #HEXCODE — [usage]
- Background: #HEXCODE — [usage]
- Text: #HEXCODE — [usage]

## Typography
- Headlines: [Font Name], [size]px, [weight]
- Body: [Font Name], [size]px, [weight]
- Captions: [Font Name], [size]px, [weight]

## Background
[Description of background treatment]

## Animation Style
[Description: e.g., "Smooth 0.5s ease-out transitions, subtle scale effects"]

## Layout Rules
- Safe margins: [X]px sides, [Y]px top/bottom
- Text alignment: [center/left/right]
- Element spacing: [X]px

## Scene Visual Template
[Description of the default visual structure for a scene]
```

**Output**: `STYLES.md` in the video directory.

**Validation**:
- Colors are valid hex codes.
- Font choices are available via Google Fonts or are web-safe.
- Style is consistent and reproducible across all scenes.
- Every scene in `scenes.json` has non-empty `visual_notes`.
- `visual_notes` reference specific colors from the palette defined in `STYLES.md`.
- `visual_notes` specify animation types consistent with the style guide.

---

### STEP 8: Remotion Code Writing

**Goal**: Write the Remotion project code for all scenes.

**This is the most complex step. Take it slow and methodical.**

**Action**:

#### 8a. Scaffold the project

```bash
python3 pipeline.py new "{video-title}"
```

This creates the directory structure, copies foundation config, generates starter
files (Root.tsx with single composition, config.ts, styles.ts), and installs
npm dependencies.

If the `videos/{video-title}/remotion/` directory already has files, skip scaffolding.

#### 8b. Load the Remotion best practices skill

Read `skills/remotion-best-practices/skills/remotion/SKILL.md` and its referenced
rule files. Key rules to load:
- `rules/video-layout.md` — layout and text sizing
- `rules/voiceover.md` — audio integration patterns
- `rules/calculate-metadata.md` — dynamic duration
- `rules/transitions.md` — scene transitions
- `rules/sequencing.md` — timing with `<Sequence>`
- `rules/compositions.md` — composition structure
- `rules/effects.md` — visual effects patterns

#### 8c. Write PLAN.md

Before writing any code, create `remotion/PLAN.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Configuration
- FPS: {from scenes.json}
- Resolution: {width}x{height}
- Total duration: {total_actual_seconds}s = {total_frames} frames

## Shared Components
- [List reusable components to create]

## Scenes
### Scene 1: {title}
- Duration: {actual_duration_frames} frames
- Visual: {visual_notes from scenes.json — set by Step 7}
- Audio: voiceover/scene-01.mp3
- Key elements: [what needs to animate]
- Transition in: {transition_in}
- Transition out: {transition_out}

### Scene 2: {title}
...

## Style Reference
{Key points from STYLES.md}
```

#### 8d. Write the code

1. Copy/symlink voiceover files into `remotion/public/voiceover/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r ../voiceover/ public/voiceover/
   ```

2. Write `src/Root.tsx` — define a single `<Composition id="MainVideo">` with
   `calculateMetadata` that reads scene durations from `props`. Use `--props`
   JSON at render time to pass scene data, not hard-coded config.

3. Write `src/lib/config.ts` — export scene data (durations, paths, fps).

4. Write shared components in `src/components/` — reusable visual elements
   defined in STYLES.md.

5. Write each scene component in `src/scenes/SceneXX.tsx`:
   - Use `useCurrentFrame()` + `interpolate()` for animations
   - Use `<Audio>` from `@remotion/media` for voiceover
   - Use `<Sequence>` for sub-timing within the scene
   - NO CSS transitions/animations
   - NO Tailwind animation classes
   - Use `staticFile()` for assets
   - Use individual CSS transform properties (scale, translate, rotate)
     instead of composing a `transform` string

6. Each scene must:
   - Match its `actual_duration_frames` exactly
   - **NOT include voiceover audio** — scenes render SILENT video. Voiceover is
     muxed at stitch time by `scripts/assemble.py`. Do NOT use `<Audio>` from
     `@remotion/media` for the voiceover. (Background music/SFX, if any, are
     still allowed via `<Audio>`.)
   - Implement the visual treatment from `visual_notes` in `scenes.json`
   - Follow the style system from STYLES.md
   - Have proper text sizing per video-layout.md rules
   - (Optional) Render `<Captions cues={scene.captions} fps={fps} />` from
     `remotion-foundation` when `scene.showCaptions` is true — this is only
     active if `video.burn_captions: true` in `pipeline_config.json`.

**Output**: Complete Remotion project in `remotion/` + `PLAN.md`.

**Validation**:
- `src/Root.tsx` exists and exports `RemotionRoot` with single `<Composition id="MainVideo">`.
- `src/components/MainVideo.tsx` exists with Sequence-based scene loading.
- Each scene has a corresponding `SceneXX.tsx` file.
- Scene count matches `scenes.json` scene count.
- Frame durations match `actual_duration_frames` from `scenes.json`.
- No CSS transitions or animations used.
- All animations use `interpolate()` or `spring()`.
- Voiceover files are in `public/voiceover/`.

---

### STEP 9: Scene Rendering

**Goal**: Render each scene as a separate MP4 file.

**CRITICAL**: Render one scene at a time. Do NOT attempt parallel rendering.

**Lint/typecheck gate**: `pipeline.py continue` runs `npm run lint`, `tsc --noEmit`,
and `remotion compositions src/Root.tsx` before any render. If any of those fail,
step 9 fails without rendering scenes. Fix Step 8 issues before re-running.

**Action**:

For each scene (1 through N), sequentially:

```bash
python3 scripts/render_scene.py videos/{video-title}/ {scene_id}
```

The script:
- Builds a props JSON from `scenes.json` with all scene durations
  (`audioFile` is intentionally empty — scenes are silent)
- Calculates the frame range for the specific scene (`--frames`)
- Renders only that scene's portion of the single `MainVideo` composition
- Handles all guardrails via `psutil` (RAM/disk checks) and orphaned-Chrome
  cleanup (smart: only kills chrome-headless-shell whose parent node/remotion
  process is no longer alive)
- Updates `render_status`, `render_attempts`, `last_render_error` per scene
- Writes an append-only log to `videos/<title>/logs/step-9-scene-{id}.log`

**Between scenes**: Wait for the script to complete before starting the next.
Monitor output for errors. **A failed scene does NOT abort the batch** — the
orchestrator records the failure and continues. Re-running `continue` skips
already-rendered scenes and retries only the failed ones.

**Output**: `scenes/scene-XX.mp4` files.

**Validation** (after ALL scenes are rendered):
- All MP4 files exist in `scenes/` directory and have non-zero size.
- `scenes.json` has `render_status: "rendered"` for every scene.
- Total disk usage is within system limits.
- Logs in `videos/<title>/logs/step-9-scene-*.log` show no errors.

**If a scene fails**:
1. Read the per-scene log: `videos/<title>/logs/step-9-scene-{id}.log`
2. Read the `last_render_error` field for the scene in `scenes.json`
3. Run `pkill -f chrome` to clean up leftover processes.
4. Wait 30 seconds.
5. Re-run `python3 pipeline.py continue <title>` — only the failed scene(s)
   will be re-attempted.
6. If still failing, run `bash scripts/check_system.sh` and consider reducing
   quality settings in `pipeline_config.json` (resolution, `crf`, `node_max_old_space_size_mb`).

---

### STEP 10: Stitching

**Goal**: Combine all scene videos with voiceover audio into the final output.

**Action**:

```bash
python3 scripts/assemble.py videos/{video-title}/
```

The script:
1. Concatenates all voiceover MP3 files in scene order -> `voiceover_aligned.mp3`
2. Concatenates all scene MP4 video streams (copy, no re-encode)
3. Overlays audio on video with `-c:v copy -c:a aac` (no video re-encode)
4. Auto-increments version number: `versions/{title}-v1.mp4`, `v2`, etc.
5. Cleans up intermediate files

**Output**: `versions/{video-title}-v{N}.mp4` — the final deliverable.

**Validation**:
- Final MP4 exists and is playable.
- Duration matches expected total (within 1 second).
- Audio is present and synced.
- File size is reasonable for the duration.
- `voiceover_aligned.mp3` exists with correct total duration.

---

### STEP 11: Metadata Generation

**Goal**: Generate YouTube title variants, description with chapters/timestamps, and tags for the stitched video.

**Action**:

1. Load the claude-youtube metadata sub-skill:
   `skills/claude-youtube/skills/claude-youtube/sub-skills/metadata.md`
2. Also load the SEO playbook reference:
   `skills/claude-youtube/skills/claude-youtube/references/seo-playbook.md`
3. Read the stitched video output from `versions/` directory.
4. Read `scenes.json` for accurate chapter timestamps based on actual scene durations.
5. Produce the following files in the video directory:

**TITLE.md** — 3 title variants (search-optimised, browse-optimised, hybrid):
- All under 100 characters
- Primary keyword in first 40 characters
- Genuinely distinct strategies, not minor word swaps

**DESCRIPTION.md** — Full 5000-char description:
- Primary keyword in first 25 words
- First 2 lines compelling standalone (visible before "Show More")
- TIMESTAMPS section with accurate chapter markers matching `scenes.json` durations
- Resource links, channel boilerplate, 3-5 hashtags at the bottom (not in title)

**TAGS.md** — 10-15 comma-separated tags:
- Exact target keyword first, then variations, then broad terms
- Total under 500 characters

**Output**: `TITLE.md`, `DESCRIPTION.md`, `TAGS.md` in the video directory.

**Validation**:
- All title variants are under 100 characters.
- Primary keyword appears in first 40 characters of every title.
- Description has keyword in first 25 words.
- Description under 5000 characters (verified).
- Timestamps start at 0:00 with at least 3 chapters.
- Tags under 500 characters total.
- Hashtags in description body, never in title.
- First 2 description lines work as standalone ad copy.

---

### STEP 12: Thumbnail Generation

**Goal**: Write a Remotion `Thumbnail.tsx` composition (no AI-generated images).

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT use any AI image generation (NanoBanana, Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.).
The thumbnail must be composed entirely of Remotion primitives: shapes, text,
gradients, and optionally local `staticFile()` assets.

**Action**:

1. Load the claude-youtube thumbnail sub-skill for the design brief:
   `skills/claude-youtube/skills/claude-youtube/sub-skills/thumbnail.md`
2. Also load the thumbnail CTR guide:
   `skills/claude-youtube/skills/claude-youtube/references/thumbnail-ctr-guide.md`
3. Read `TITLE.md`, `DESCRIPTION.md`, `STYLES.md`, and `scenes.json` for context.
4. Follow the thumbnail sub-skill's brief structure (information split, focal point,
   ≤3-word text overlay, hex palette, mobile-legibility at 168×94px).
5. Write `src/components/Thumbnail.tsx` using ONLY:
   - `<AbsoluteFill>` for the container
   - `<Img>` only for local assets via `staticFile()` (no external URLs)
   - Native Remotion shapes (divs with CSS, gradients, borders)
   - Text with proper typography from STYLES.md palette
   - `interpolate()` / `spring()` if any animation is needed
   - The `ThumbnailProps` interface from `remotion-foundation`:
     `{ title: string, subtitle: string, palette: { primary, secondary, accent, background, text } }`
6. Verify the composition compiles:
   ```bash
   cd videos/{video-title}/remotion
   npm run lint
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
7. The `Thumbnail` composition is already registered in `Root.tsx` — do NOT duplicate it.

**Output**: `src/components/Thumbnail.tsx` in the per-video Remotion project.

**Validation**:
- No AI-generated image assets used.
- No `fetch()` or external URLs in the component.
- Component uses only the props passed via `ThumbnailProps`.
- Text overlay ≤3 words (or as specified by the thumbnail brief).
- Palette colors from STYLES.md or the brief, not hard-coded.
- Composition passes `npm run lint` and `tsc --noEmit`.
- `Thumbnail` composition appears in `npx remotion compositions src/Root.tsx` output.

---

### STEP 13: Thumbnail Rendering

**Goal**: Render the Thumbnail composition to a PNG file via Remotion still.

**Lint/typecheck gate**: `pipeline.py continue` runs `npm run lint`, `tsc --noEmit`,
and `remotion compositions src/Root.tsx` before rendering. The gate now checks for
both `MainVideo` and `Thumbnail` compositions. If either is missing, the step fails.

**Action**:

```bash
python3 scripts/render_thumbnail.py videos/{video-title}/
```

The script:
- Reads `TITLE.md` (or falls back to `scenes.json video_title`) for the title text
- Reads `STYLES.md` for the color palette
- Builds `ThumbnailProps` JSON from those values
- Runs `npx remotion still src/Root.tsx Thumbnail <out.png> --frame=0` with the props
- Writes output to `versions/{title}-thumbnail-v{N}.png` (auto-incremented)
- Uses `--quality=100` for maximum PNG output quality
- Records an append-only log to `videos/<title>/logs/step-13.log`

**Output**: `versions/{video-title}-thumbnail-v{N}.png` — the deliverable thumbnail.

**Validation**:
- Output PNG exists and has non-zero size.
- Resolution is 1280×720+ (matches the Remotion composition dimensions).
- File is a valid PNG image.
- Logs show no errors.

## Error Recovery

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| `edge-tts` network failure | Step 5 retries each scene once after a 5s backoff. Re-run `continue` — unchanged scenes are skipped (idempotent). |
| Remotion render OOM | The scene's `last_render_error` records the OOM. `render_attempts` is incremented. Kill Chrome (`pkill -f chrome`), wait 60s, re-run `continue` to retry just that scene. If persistent, reduce `node_max_old_space_size_mb` or video resolution in `pipeline_config.json`. |
| Remotion render timeout | Increase `timeout_ms` in config, or simplify the scene's visual complexity. |
| ffmpeg stitch failure | `assemble.py` validates inputs first; on codec/resolution mismatch across scenes it falls back to re-encoding. Re-run `continue`. |
| Disk full | Run `rm -rf videos/{title}/remotion/node_modules` to free space, or clean up previous video projects. |
| Schema validation fails | `pipeline.py continue` refuses to run automated steps. Run `pipeline.py validate <title>` to see the specific violations and fix the offending JSON. |
| Lint gate fails before render | Fix the TypeScript/lint errors in the Remotion project (`cd videos/<title>/remotion && npm run lint`). `tsc --noEmit` errors must also be resolved. |
| Metadata step fails | `pipeline.py continue` re-runs the creative Step 11. Check `TITLE.md`, `DESCRIPTION.md`, `TAGS.md` are all present and valid. |
| Thumbnail composition fails lint | Fix `Thumbnail.tsx` TypeScript/lint errors. Remove any AI image references. |
| Thumbnail still render fails | The Step 13 render uses `npx remotion still`. Check logs in `videos/<title>/logs/step-13.log`. Ensure `Thumbnail` composition is registered in `Root.tsx` and passes `remotion compositions` check. |

State forensics: each step's `pipeline_state.json` entry now carries
`attempts`, `last_error`, and `last_attempt_at`. Scene-level failures record
`render_attempts` and `last_render_error` per scene in `scenes.json`.

## Progress Tracking

Use `pipeline_state.json` to track which steps are complete. Before starting
any step, check if it's already marked complete (for resuming interrupted runs).

Update the file after each step completes:
```json
{
  "video_title": "...",
  "current_step": 5,
  "steps": {
    "1_topic_selection": {"status": "complete", "completed_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"},
    "2_research": {"status": "complete", "completed_at": "2025-01-15T10:45:00Z"},
    ...
  }
}
```

## Resuming Interrupted Pipelines

Use `python3 pipeline.py continue {title}` to resume. The pipeline:
1. Validates `scenes.json` + `pipeline_state.json` against the schemas
   (`scripts/validate.py`). Refuses to run automated steps on invalid state.
2. Reads `pipeline_state.json` to find the last completed step.
3. Runs the next automated step (5, 6, 9, 10, or 13), or
4. Prints instructions for creative steps (1-4, 7, 8, 11, 12).
5. Steps 5-6 involve file generation. Step 5 is idempotent — unchanged scenes
   are skipped. Step 6 measures all scenes (idempotent validation).
6. Steps 7-8 involve code — `lint_gate` (lint + tsc) runs before Step 9.
7. Steps 9-10 involve rendering — Step 9 resumes per-scene via
   `render_status: "rendered"` + new `render_attempts` tracking. Step 10
   always re-stitches atomically into a new versioned MP4.
8. Step 11 is creative (title/description/tags written to files).
9. Step 12 is creative (Thumbnail.tsx composition written).
10. Step 13 runs automated with a lint gate before the still render.

Logs append to `videos/<title>/logs/` across runs — review them after
overnight failures. Schema violations cause immediate halt with a readable
error list rather than silent corruption downstream.
